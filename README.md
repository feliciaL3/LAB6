Taxi Company.
 	In this simulation, the operator answers customer calls, proposes a car (model, type, color) and the accountant sets the price for the ride. The price of the ride in relation to the number of customers at the time, according to the formula
	 MoneyCombustible = MoneyCombustible + NumberClients * CombustiblePrice.
This way we can find out the money from the day in total, and the total money of the company and from here you can see some actions. 
*If the money is less than n, a representative of the company partnerships will help the taxi company with money, and if there is more money, the taxi company will be able to call on a Marketolog who will advertise for the company. Depending on money and the number of customers, advertising can be of different types. If the advertising will happen, the director will improve the company.
*On a randomly generated day, and if the total money is more than n, the mechanics will start repairing the cars, and from the total money of the company will be 
 removed the price of the car.
 *If the clients are less than n, the driver will go on break.
*If there will be no more money, cars or drivers, the company will close.
*If the company will be closed, the director will leave.
*One day, randomly generated, the company can close and the simulation can stop then.
